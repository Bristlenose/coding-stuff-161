/**
Exercise 3:

What is the name of the method where statement execution begins in a Java program?

main

What output is produced by the following statement?
System.out.println("2 plus 2 is " + 2 + 2);

2 plus 2 is 22
2 is appended to the string twice and no math is done, to get 4 you need brackets around 2+2

What output is produced by the following statement?
System.out.println( 20 + 20 + " is the new thirty.");

40 is the new thirty
as it is done before the string the math is done before the string is appended to 40
